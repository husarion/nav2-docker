# nav2-docker
Dockerized [Nav2](https://navigation.ros.org/) nodes with custom Husarion launch in order to simplify running [navigation2](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2) with [slam_toolbox](https://github.com/SteveMacenski/slam_toolbox) nodes or amcl node. Main purpose of this docker is to bring out of the box solution of Navigation2 docker for all ROS platforms. This docker supports all *AMD64* *ARM64* and *ARM32* architectures.

For more details about our own launch file read it's [README.md](./src/husarion_nav2/README.md)
